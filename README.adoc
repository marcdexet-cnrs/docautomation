== Goals

* To produce set of documentation following Quality Standards
* To limit the burden of gathering information without added value
* To manage and configure documentation as code
* To not repeat yoursef (DRY)

== Vision

A engineer has no added value into fighting with que quality process. We have to help her.
A lot of the burden is due to various tasks and concern that could be automatable.

* build an exact reference for the document according to a pattern
* update version number
* include exact reference from applicable documents
* check the last version of applicable documents
* check if the worklow has been followed

TBC
